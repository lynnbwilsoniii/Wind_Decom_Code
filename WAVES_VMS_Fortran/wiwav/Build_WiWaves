Building the Wind WAVES Software for MacOS:
------------------------------------------

1. Choose where your wish to install.  For the purposes of this example,
   assume that you will install in directory:

       /wind/software

   In these instructions, replace this directory name with your
   own installation directory name.

   This will result in a Wind WAVES installation directory:

       /wind/software/wiwav

2. Get the tar-file of the release, which is:

       wind_wav_macosx.tar

   and copy it into "/wind/software".

3. Extract the release:

      cd /wind/software

      tar xvf wind_wav_macosx.tar

   This will result in the creation of the installation directory:

      /wind/software/wiwav

4. Go to the "src" directory:

      cd /wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d/src

5. If this is a MacOS-Intel build, enter:

      cp  Makefile.macos_intel  Makefile

   If this is a MacOS-PPC build, enter:

      cp  Makefile.macos_ppc  Makefile

6. Edit the "Makefile" and, at about line 76, change the "BASEDIR"
   line to equal your choice in step (1).

       BASEDIR = /wind/software/wiwav

   (i.e. "BASEDIR" is the name of your installation directory)

   Also, line 7, indicating the location of your local ABSOFT
   Fortran installation should be set as required.   Typically,
   ABSOFT is installed in:

   For PPC:

      /Applications/Absoft

   For Intel:

      /Applications/Absoft10

7. Note:  if we are every dealing with a version higher than v1.7d,
   then you will also have to change line 4:

       WIND_VERSION = v1.7d

   to reflect that.

8. Make certain that the correct version of:

       wind_os_def.for

   is being used.

   For Intel:

       cp  wind_os_def.for.macos_intel  wind_os_def.for

   For PPC:

       cp  wind_os_def.for.macos_ppc  wind_os_def.for

9. "make" the libraries (and "qdb" program), by entering::

       make all

   This will result in the creation of the following:

      In "/wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d/lib":

	  libIDL_WAVES.so
	  libWAVES.so.1.1
	  libWIND.a

      In "/wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d/bin":

	  qdb
       
10. Create a symbolic link for "libWAVES.so.1.1":

      cd /wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d/lib

      ln -s libWAVES.so.1.1 libWAVES.so

11. Go to the "wiwav/v1.7d/lib" directory, and establish a
    symbolic link to the CDF libraries, which were included
    in the tar-package:

      cd  /wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d/lib

      ln -s ../cdf/lib/libcdf.a .
      ln -s ../cdf/lib/libcdf.so .

    These are CDF 3.1 libraries.

12. You may want to edit the file:

       /wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d/idl/wind_idl.pro

    and replace the use of the environment variable:

	WIWAV_IDL_LIB

    with another more suitable to your site.

13. To set a user's environment to make use of the WAVES library, the
    following lines should be included, for those using "bash" or "sh",
    in "$HOME/.profile":

	export WIND_WAV_BASE; WIND_WAV_BASE=/wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d
	export WIND_WAV_IDL; WIND_WAV_IDL=$WIND_WAV_BASE/idl
	export WIND_WAV_SRC; WIND_WAV_SRC=$WIND_WAV_BASE/src
	export WIND_DATA; WIND_DATA=<where_ever_your_wind_data_is_stored>
	export WIND_DBMS; WIND_DBMS=$WIND_WAV_BASE/dbms
	export WIND_DBMS_AUX; WIND_DBMS_AUX=$WIND_DBMS/aux
	export WIWAV_IDL_LIB; WIWAV_IDL_LIB=$WIND_WAV_BASE/lib/libIDL_WAVES.so
	IDL_PATH=$WIND_WAV_IDL:$IDL_PATH

    For those using "csh", tcsh", put the following lines in '$HOME/.cshrc":

	setenv WIND_WAV_BASE /wind/software/wiwav/v1.7d
	setenv WIND_WAV_IDL $WIND_WAV_BASE/idl
	setenv WIND_WAV_SRC $WIND_WAV_BASE/src
	setenv WIND_DATA <where_ever_your_wind_data_is_stored>
	setenv WIND_DBMS $WIND_WAV_BASE/dbms
	setenv WIND_DBMS_AUX $WIND_DBMS/aux
	setenv WIWAV_IDL_LIB $WIND_WAV_BASE/lib/libIDL_WAVES.so
	setenv IDL_PATH  "${WIND_WAV_IDL}:+${IDL_PATH}"

14. "WIND_DATA", "WIND_DBMS", and "WIND_DBMS_AUX" have been, and
     continue to be used by Windlib users.  The following environment
     variables:

	WIND_WAV_BASE
	WIND_WAV_IDL
	WIND_WAV_SRC
	WINDWAV_IDL_LIB

    may already been defined by pre-existing variables that current
    users have set.   In that case, the "Makefile" edits, specified
    in (6), can be modified to make use of that, and the file:

       v1.7d/idl/wind_idl.pro

    can be edited to make use of that as well.   You would change
    all cases of the string:

       WIWAV_IDL_LIB

    to make use of the older environment variable(s).
