c      Subroutines called by sdf_lister.for
c      These subroutines are ment to be a simple way to add code to sdf_lister
c      Summary:
c              subroutine sdf_initial 
c                    sdf_lister first calls this subroutine.  Put code to initialize values and
c                    open files here.  
c
c              subroutine sdf_process
c                    sdf_lister calls this subroutine after each major frame is read, decoded
c                    and processed.  Put analysis and write code here.
c
c              subroutine sdf_final
c                    Before ending, sdf_lister calls this subroutine.  Close files here
