****************** Notes on the 'swe_summary' survey data type:
*************************** Last modified: (02/25/02)

This data type is generated using the SWE_summ_v1_1.pro routine--where data
 from the 'swe_moments', 'swe_ionkp' and 'swe_strahlen' (energy 0 is 135eV
 and energy 1 is 251eV) survey data types are collected into yearly files
 and saved in an IDL-restorable format.  Its purpose is to provide a
 convenient, unified representation of the contents of the above three
 survey data types.

The 'interpol' function (from the IDL library) is used to perform LINEAR
 interpolation from the electron and strahl time resolutions to the ion
 time resolution.  Ultimately, all variables are represented as functions
 of ion time; and only the ion (PB5) times are stored.

Since the data for this survey data type is generated within the SWEDAT tool
 environment by the survey routines for each respective survey data type,
 there is little to do when performing a READ operation (simply RESTORE and
 select the data in the interval of interest--discard the rest).

Similarly, the names of the variables are identical to the corresponding
 members of the survey data types from which each time series takes its
 values.  In fact, most of the survey routines for this survey data type are
 derived directly form the corresponding routines of the original three
 survey data types.
