                     Help for ISEE Survey Data Display

Both the ISEE moments and distribution function data are in the same .cdf file,
one record per 3sec spin period of data every 9s or 18s. 

BUTTON/FIELD     	ACTION


ISEE moments		Reads data files of ISEE moments. Select a file 
			from the list. The entire file (one day) will
			be read and stored, including the time array
			which serves as an index for finding the record
			number corresponding to the time selected
			when plotting distribution function data. 
			Therefore moments data MUST be read and plotted
			BEFORE clicking on the "ISEE f" button.
			File identifier is year and decimal day 
			(jan 1 =0 dday). After data is read,
 			make plot selection from the pop-up list of
 			available moments data variables.

ISEE f			Reads and plots distribution function data.
			Click on "ISEE f" which
			brings up ISEE f Data Display containing
			plot windows for distribution function data.
