                  Help for ISEE Distribution Function Data Display

----------- Plot panels -------------------------------------
Top plot panel: The data plotted in the top panel of the GGS Survey Data Display
is plotted here. Vertical line appears at the time of the distribution function
being plotted in lower panels.

Bottom three panels: Distribuion functions are plotted here.


------- To select time and plot distribution function -------------------------
There are four ways to select times for plotting ISEE distribution function data:
1. Click at desired time in the top panel (with left mouse button) and plot 
will appear in one of three bottom panels. Successive clicks on top panel will 
cause plots to cycle through the three bottom plot panels.
2. Click on any of three bottom panels and the plot at currently selected time 
will appear.
3. Click on "+" or "-" button to increment the time index; the plot at newly 
selected time will appear. Successive clicks on "+" or "-" will cause plots to 
cycle through the three plot panels. 
4. Return to parent, GGS Survey Data Display, (click "Parent") and select time
on survey plot. Come back to ISEE f Data Display 
(click "ISEE f" in GGS Survey Data Display widget) and click on a window.

When a time is selected by one of the above methods, f-data for that time is
read and stored. Various types of plots as listed below may be selected and
plotted using the stored f-data. 


-------- Buttons to select plot type  -------------------------
BUTTON			ACTION

f-contours		Contours of f on perpendicular-parallel velocity grid
			with magnetic field direction along +vparallel.
 			Pitch angle bin for averaging = 6 degrees.

Reduced F      		Reduced distribution.

f-cuts			Parallel (solid line) and perpendicular (dashed
 		        line) cuts of f and measure data sampled closest to 
			magnetic field (+/-) direction (triangles).

f, F			Contours of f and reduced f. 

f, f-cuts (default)	Contours and cuts of f.

f, F, f-cuts		Contours of f, reduced f, and cuts of f.


------- Other buttons --------------------------------------
BUTTON			ACTION

Hardcopy		Makes hardcopy and sends to printer set up in startup
 			file which can be overridden using "Printer" button
			on parent widget, GGS Survey Data Display.

Parent			Returns to main or "parent" widget, 
			GGS Survey Data Display.
			From GGS Survey Data Display, hit "ISEE f"
			to get back to this "child" widget.
			NOTE: In most or all cases, use parent and child buttons
			to go back and forth between widget displays. Avoid
			using the windows mouse functions to bring windows
			forward. 

Quit			Normal exit.
