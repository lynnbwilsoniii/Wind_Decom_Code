General.....

The file glintdates (ascii) associates every day from 941130 to 961231
with a glint map identifier, which is the date for which the glint map was made.

The file glintdates is created and updated using procedure glintdates.pro.

The glint map identifier is the file name identifier <yymmdd> for a procedure
dglint_m1_<yymmdd>.pro (ex: dglint_m1_941130.pro) which idl-restores the 
appropriate glint map and/or explicitly defines glint map elements.

Glint maps have the form 19<yymmdd>*_m1.glntmap.


How to use..... 

In the WGGS analysis tool, procedure phase_m1.pro is executed once for the given
level zero data date, lzdate. Procedure phasem1 reads file glintdates and finds
glintdate corresponding to lzdate. Using glintdate as file identifier, the 
approriate dglint_m1_<lzdate>.pro is executed which in turns reads and stores
the glint map to be used, ex: 19960715_std2.0_m1.glntmap.
